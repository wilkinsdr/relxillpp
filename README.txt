#####  README of the RELXILL model  #####
#########################################

Please read the following instructions carefully in order to ensure a
properly working version of the model. Note that this model is
designed and tested to be used within the X-ray spectral fitting
software ISIS and XSPEC. 

(1) Installing the model:

  - Do the compile script executable by "chmod u+x compile_relxill.sh"

  - Execute "./compile_relxill.sh"

(2) Setting up the model environment:

  - Most importantly the model needs to know where the pre-calculated
    tables are located. By default it is assumed that they are in the
    current working directory.

  - The recommended approach is to set the environment variable
    "RELXILL_TABLE_PATH" to the path where the tables are stored. That
    means (for a csh environment) putting a line like the following in
    the .cshrc:
    "setenv RELXILL_TABLE_PATH /home/user/data/relline_tables/"

(3) Loading the model in XSPEC:

  From the directory where the model has been installed, the model can
  simply be loaded inside XSPEC: "lmod relxill .".
